# hello-world
My first repository in Github
In my early days I worked with IBM mainframes with OS/MVS, PL/1, Cobol and Assembler 370.
I design systems using hierachical data base systems and then relational dbms always in IBM main frame systems.
Now, after a life of management consulting and banking, I decide to learn the new development environments and new programming languages.
I did start with a friendly and easy environment, using Excel and VBA to understand what classes, methods and properties are.
To learn the Gitub environment is part of may way.
